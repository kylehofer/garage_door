# Garage Door Control
Arduino sketch for controlling my garage door using simple controls. The only control available is a single push button switch, and feedback from the door is gathered from using a potentiometer. Data is transferred between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi Zero using serial over USB. The Raspberry PI also uses MQTT to both publish and read data with other devices.
